    <h1  >About Me</h1>
    <p>I was originally interested in becoming a math professor. While pursuing my PhD, I found that this wasn't the right path for me and decided to make a change. I wanted to earn a decent living and have more time to pursue personal projects. I became more interested in things like artificial intelligence and wanted to apply my math background to developing new tools. I had already had a good background in programming (I was one of those Linux/C++ computer science purists who converted to math because I found it more fun), so I found myself in an ideal place to understand the theory and the practice behind these tools. My focus was primarily on differentiable dynamical systems, algebraic topology, and analysis, but I constantly felt inspired to phrase AI stuff in these languages. My eventual goal is to becomee a Machine Learning Engineer so that I could continue learning about the latest developments and glean inspiration for research projects.</p>
    
    <p> I typically use Python, Tensorflow, Pytorch, SQL, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.sagemath.org/">Sage</a> in my research. I dabble in HTML/CSS/PHP, javascript, and AWS as well. I wrote this website and stood it up on Amazon.</p>
    
    <p>Onto some personal stuff!</p>
    <p>I'm an amateur painter:</p>

        <img width="25%" height="25%" src=images/torus.jpg>
        <img width="25%" height="25%" src=images/landscape.jpg></div></center>
    <p>I'm an amateur musician. I mainly play guitar and try to sing.
        Here are some covers me and my friend recorded, excuse the audio quality: </p>
    <center> <audio controls> <source src="files/Hybrid2.mp3" type="audio/mp3"> </audio>
        <p> (Cover) The Misfits - Hybrid Moments (Vocals/Rhythm: Friend, Lead/Solo: Me) </p></center>
    <center> <audio controls> <source src="files/Time.mp3" type="audio/mp3"> </audio>
        <p> (Cover) Pink Floyd - Time (Lead: Friend, Vocals/Rhythm/Solo: Me) </p></center>
    <p>One day I'll put on some original works once I figure out how to get stuff onto Spotify.</p>
    <p>Other than that, I'm a dog owner, nature enthusiast, archer, fisherman, and mathematician.</p>
